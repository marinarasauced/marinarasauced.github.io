MESS2 Documentation
==========================================

**The Modular Experiment Software System 2 (MESS2) is a modular ROS2 interface designed for Coupled Sensor Configuration and Planning (CSCP) research.**
Designed by the `ACE Lab <https://labs.wpi.edu/ace-lab/>`__, MESS2 utilizes a suite of TurtleBot3 UGVs and custom build Hawk UAVs integrated with a VICON motion capture system to validate CSCP algorithms.

MESS began development as part of the `Coupled Sensor Configuration and Planning <https://digital.wpi.edu/concern/student_works/2j62s931w?locale=en>`__ Major Qualifying Project (MQP) at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in 2024. The original MESS system utilized ROS1 Noetic; however, it has since been migrated to ROS2 Humble.
